# Trig Ratios
Retrieved from [TSSOJ](https://tssoj.ca/)

## Problem Description
Java implements the three basic trigonometry ratios as functions from the Math class.  
Each ratio takes an angle in radians and returns the value of the ratio:

- `Math.sin(double);`
- `Math.cos(double);`
- `Math.tan(double);`

Given an angle in degrees, print the value of its sine, cosine, and tangent.

## Input Specification
The input is an integer between 0 and 90 representing the angle in degrees.

## Output Specification
Output the angle's sine, cosine, and tangent each on a new line rounded to 2 decimal places. Do not print trailing zeroes. This means that instead of 0.50, you should output 0.5.

## Sample I/O 

### Sample Input
`30`
### Sample Output
```
0.5
0.87
0.58
```
