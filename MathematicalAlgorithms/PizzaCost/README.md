Retrieved from [TSSOJ](https://tssoj.ca/)

## Problem Description
The cost of making a pizza at a Regino's is as follows:

- Labour cost is $0.75 per pizza, regardless of size.

- Materials is $0.05 * diameter * diameter (diameter is measured in inches)

Create a PizzaCost application that takes the size of a pizza as input and then displays the cost of making the pizza. For ICS3U students submitting solutions in Java, communication marks will be given for adding a header comment and naming constants using the proper naming convention. Hint: constants are created by using the keyword 
*final* and are used in place of literal numbers that have a meaning.

## Input Specification
