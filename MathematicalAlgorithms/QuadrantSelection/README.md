# Quadrant Selection
Retrieved from [TSSOJ](https://tssoj.ca/)

## Problem Description
In a Cartesian Plane, a grid is divided into 4 parts. Points on a Cartesian Plane can be represented with coordinates. Points in the top right quadrant of the plane have a positive `x` and positive `y` value. This quadrant is referred to as Quadrant 1. 

Your task is to determine which quadrant a point lies on, given its `x` and `y` coordinates.

## Input Specifications
The first line of input will contain `x`  
(`−10^5 ≤ x ≤ 10^5`).  
The second line of input will contain `y`  
(`−10^5 ≤ y ≤ 10^5`).

## Output Specifications
Output the quadrant number the given point lies on.

## Sample I/O

### Sample Input
`5`  
`-7`

### Sample Output
`4`
