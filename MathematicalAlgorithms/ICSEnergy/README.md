## Problem Description
Einstein's famous formula, e = m ∗ c^2
, given the amount of energy released by the complete conversion of matter with mass 
m
 into energy 
e
. If 
m
 represents the mass in kilograms and 
c
 represents the speed of light in meters per second (
3
∗
10^8
⁢
m
/
s
), then the result is in the energy unit Joules. It takes 360,000 Joules to light a 100 Watt light bulb for an hour. Create an Energy application that takes a mass in kilograms and then displays the energy and the number of light bulbs that could be powered by that amount of energy.

## Input Specification
The mass 
*m*
 in kilograms as a real number.

## Output Specification
The energy 
*e*
 in Joules on one line, followed by the number of light bulbs rounded to the nearest integer. Both numbers should be formatted as integers formatted with commas separating thousands as shown below.
